# drafted-learn

> *Because staring at a spinner is a waste of a perfectly good brain.*

A Claude Code plugin that teaches you AI/ML while Claude is thinking. Every time you hit enter, a fact from the frontier appears in your terminal — tokenization, transformers, RLHF, agent architecture, the works.

94 facts. Zero extra time required. You were going to wait anyway.

## Install

You need Claude Code. If you don't have it: [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code).

Then run these two commands:

```bash
claude /plugin marketplace add draftedlabs/drafted-learn
claude /plugin install drafted-learn@drafted-learn
```

That's it. Start a new session and send any message. The box appears.

**To uninstall:**
```bash
claude /plugin uninstall drafted-learn
```

## What you'll learn

94 facts across 8 categories, rotating randomly:

| Category | What's covered |
|---|---|
| **Foundations** | Tokens, context windows, temperature, overfitting, inference |
| **Neural Networks** | Backprop, gradient descent, CNNs, RNNs, dropout, ResNets |
| **Transformers & LLMs** | Self-attention, BERT, GPT, RLHF, KV-cache, MoE, fine-tuning |
| **AI Agents** | Agentic loops, tool use, ReAct, MCP, multi-agent systems |
| **AI History** | Turing (1950) through OpenAI o1 (2024) — the full arc |
| **Training Data** | Annotation, IAA, synthetic data, scaling laws, eval hygiene |
| **Practical ML Engineering** | Loss, RAG, embeddings, cosine similarity, precision/recall |
| **Ethics & Safety** | Hallucination, alignment, prompt injection, red-teaming |

By the time you finish a project, you'll have absorbed more AI fundamentals than most online courses teach in weeks.

## Why we built this

**[Drafted](https://joindrafted.com)** connects university students to real AI work — annotation tasks, RLHF feedback, agent evaluation, and more — for frontier AI labs building the next generation of models.

We built drafted-learn because we kept seeing the same thing: students who could *use* AI tools but couldn't explain what was happening under the hood. They'd open Claude Code, ship something, and close it — without ever knowing what a token is, what RLHF did to the model they just prompted, or why hallucinations happen.

That felt like a missed opportunity. You're already here. The spinner is already spinning. Might as well learn something.

The students who understand the stack — not just the surface — are the ones who get hired to build it. That's what Drafted is for.

## Want to do more than learn?

Drafted places students in paid AI work with real labs. If you want to go from *understanding* RLHF to *doing* RLHF, we have a spot for you.

**Apply to work on AI training data:**
[joindrafted.com/students](https://joindrafted.com/students)

You'll annotate, evaluate, and help train the models you use every day. Flexible hours, paid per task, and you learn more in one project than a semester of coursework.

University partners: USC, UChicago, Georgetown, U Miami — and growing.

## Add your own facts

Edit `data/ai-facts.json` and add an entry:

```json
{
  "id": "095",
  "category": "agents",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "text": "Your fact here. Keep it under 200 chars so it fits cleanly.",
  "source": "Your name or paper",
  "tags": ["relevant", "tags"]
}
```

PRs welcome. If you know something worth knowing, share it.

## Technical details

- Hook: `UserPromptSubmit` — fires on every prompt, before Claude responds
- Output: writes directly to `/dev/tty` so it never interferes with Claude's output
- Width: auto-adapts to your terminal width (min 40, max 120)
- Clickable CTA: OSC 8 hyperlink — works in iTerm2, Ghostty, WezTerm
- No dependencies. Just Node.js, which you already have.
